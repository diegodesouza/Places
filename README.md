## Motivation

My motivation behind this app was to help those that were in the same shoes i
was before attending Launch Academy. I went through an extensive room search to
stay for the duration of my course. I realized that people are looking for
long term renters or get rid of their leases. I saw an opportunity to minimize
this offering this app.
